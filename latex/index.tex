{\bfseries{Statistics\+Exercises}} is my personal collection of S\+A\+GE mathematical scripts for solving statistics exercises when teaching statistics classes.

These scripts perform classical parameter confidence interval calculations and hypothesis testing, correlation and simplest least-\/squares fit regression and print much detailed reports, containing with numerical values of intermediate expressions and variables, like in homework problem solutions (which packages like S\+P\+SS leave out).

This is very handy when doing step-\/by-\/step checking and grading correcting student solutions.
