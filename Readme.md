 **StatisticsExercises** is my personal collection of SAGE mathematical scripts for solving statistics exercises when teaching statistics classes.
 
 These scripts perform classical parameter confidence interval calculations and hypothesis testing, correlation and simplest least-squares fit regression and print much detailed reports, containing with numerical values of intermediate expressions and variables, like in homework problem solutions (which packages like SPSS leave out).
 
 This is very handy when doing step-by-step checking and grading correcting student solutions.
